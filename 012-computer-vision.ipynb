    "Pernah bertanya-tanya bagaimana kita bisa memahami hal-hal yang kita lihat? Ibarat kita melihat seseorang berjalan, disadari atau tidak, dengan menggunakan pengetahuan yang diperlukan, otak kita memahami apa yang terjadi dan menyimpannya sebagai informasi. Bayangkan kita melihat sesuatu dan menjadi kosong sama sekali. Terlupakan. Menakutkan bukan? Rahasia di balik cara otak kita menafsirkan gambar yang kita lihat selalu membuat saya penasaran.\n",

    "Gagasan untuk menanamkan kecerdasan dan naluri manusia ke komputer tampaknya cukup mudah. Bisa dibayangkan, karena hal ini juga dapat diselesaikan oleh anak-anak yang masih sangat kecil, namun kita sering cenderung melupakan keterbatasan komputer dibandingkan dengan kemampuan biologis kita. Kompleksitas persepsi penglihatan sangat bervariasi dan dinamis dalam kasus manusia itu sendiri, apalagi kecerdasan Komputer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otak kita memiliki kemampuan untuk mengidentifikasi objek, memproses data, dan memutuskan apa yang harus dilakukan, sehingga menyelesaikan tugas kompleks dalam hitungan detik. Tujuannya adalah agar komputer dapat melakukan hal yang sama. Oleh karena itu, ini adalah bidang yang dapat disebut sebagai penggabungan Kecerdasan Buatan dan Pembelajaran Mesin, yang melibatkan algoritma pembelajaran dan metode khusus untuk menafsirkan apa yang dilihat oleh Komputer."

    "Pengolahan Citra Digital berarti pengolahan citra digital melalui komputer digital. Kita juga dapat mengatakan bahwa ini adalah penggunaan algoritma komputer, untuk mendapatkan gambar yang disempurnakan atau untuk mengekstrak beberapa informasi berguna.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pemrosesan citra digital adalah penggunaan algoritma dan model matematika untuk memproses dan menganalisis gambar digital. Tujuan pemrosesan gambar digital adalah untuk meningkatkan kualitas gambar, mengekstrak informasi bermakna dari gambar, dan mengotomatiskan tugas-tugas berbasis gambar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basic steps involved in digital image processing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Image acquisition: This involves capturing an image using a digital camera or scanner, or importing an existing image into a computer.\n",
    "2.  Image enhancement: This involves improving the visual quality of an image, such as increasing contrast, reducing noise, and removing artifacts.\n",
    "3.  Image restoration: This involves removing degradation from an image, such as blurring, noise, and distortion.\n",
    "4.  Image segmentation: This involves dividing an image into regions or segments, each of which corresponds to a specific object or feature in the image.\n",
    "5.  Image representation and description: This involves representing an image in a way that can be analyzed and manipulated by a computer, and describing the features of an image in a compact and meaningful way.\n",
    "6.  Image analysis: This involves using algorithms and mathematical models to extract information from an image, such as recognizing objects, detecting patterns, and quantifying features.\n",
    "7.  Image synthesis and compression: This involves generating new images or compressing existing images to reduce storage and transmission requirements.\n",
    "8.  Digital image processing is widely used in a variety of applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, computer vision, and multimedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image processing mainly include the following steps:\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mengimpor gambar melalui alat akuisisi gambar;\\\n",
    "2.Menganalisis dan memanipulasi gambar;\\\n",
    "3.Output yang hasilnya dapat berupa perubahan gambar atau laporan yang didasarkan pada analisa gambar tersebut.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an image?\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is defined as a two-dimensional function,**F(x,y)**, where x and y are spatial coordinates, and the amplitude of **F** at any pair of coordinates (x,y) is called the **intensity** of that image at that point. When x,y, and amplitude values of **F** are finite, we call it a**digital image**.\\\n",
    "In other words, an image can be defined by a two-dimensional array specifically arranged in rows and columns.\\\n",
    "Digital Image is composed of a finite number of elements, each of which elements have a particular value at a particular location.These elements are referred to as*picture elements,image elements,and pixels*.A *Pixel* is most widely used to denote the elements of a Digital Image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of an image\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **BINARY IMAGE**-- The binary image as its name suggests, contain only two pixel elements i.e 0 & 1,where 0 refers to black and 1 refers to white. This image is also known as Monochrome.\n",
    "2.  **BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE**-- The image which consist of only black and white color is called BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE.\n",
    "3.  **8 bit COLOR FORMAT**-- It is the most famous image format.It has 256 different shades of colors in it and commonly known as Grayscale Image. In this format, 0 stands for Black, and 255 stands for white, and 127 stands for gray.\n",
    "4.  **16 bit COLOR FORMAT**-- It is a color image format. It has 65,536 different colors in it.It is also known as High Color Format. In this format the distribution of color is not as same as Grayscale image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 16 bit format is actually divided into three further formats which are Red, Green and Blue. That famous RGB format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image as a Matrix\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, images are represented in rows and columns we have the following syntax in which images are represented:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gfg2-5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The right side of this equation is digital image by definition. Every element of this matrix is called image element , picture element , or pixel.\n",

    "\n",
    "In MATLAB the start index is from 1 instead of 0. Therefore, f(1,1) = f(0,0).\\\n",
    "henceforth the two representation of image are identical, except for the shift in origin.\\\n",
    "In MATLAB, matrices are stored in a variable i.e X,x,input_image , and so on. The variables must be a letter as same as other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "PHASES OF IMAGE PROCESSING:\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**ACQUISITION**-- It could be as simple as being given an image which is in digital form. The main work involves:\\\n",
    "a) Scaling\\\n",
    "b) Color conversion(RGB to Gray or vice-versa)\\\n",
    "2.**IMAGE ENHANCEMENT**-- It is amongst the simplest and most appealing in areas of Image Processing it is also used to extract some hidden details from an image and is subjective.\\\n",
    "3.**IMAGE RESTORATION**-- It also deals with appealing of an image but it is objective(Restoration is based on mathematical or probabilistic model or image degradation).\\\n",
    "4.**COLOR IMAGE PROCESSING**-- It deals with pseudocolor and full color image processing color models are applicable to digital image processing.\\\n",
    "5.**WAVELETS AND MULTI-RESOLUTION PROCESSING**-- It is foundation of representing images in various degrees.\\\n",
    "6.**IMAGE COMPRESSION**-It involves in developing some functions to perform this operation. It mainly deals with image size or resolution.\\\n",
    "7.**MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSING**-It deals with tools for extracting image components that are useful in the representation & description of shape.\\\n",
    "8.**SEGMENTATION PROCEDURE**-It includes partitioning an image into its constituent parts or objects. Autonomous segmentation is the most difficult task in Image Processing.\\\n",
    "9.**REPRESENTATION & DESCRIPTION**-It follows output of segmentation stage, choosing a representation is only the part of solution for transforming raw data into processed data.\\\n",
    "10.**OBJECT DETECTION AND RECOGNITION**-It is a process that assigns a label to an object based on its descriptor.Â \n",
